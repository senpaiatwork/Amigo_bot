#### Discription: 
Amigo bot Comes with
ESP32 - CAM for OpenCV with Pan and tilt accessibility
Ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance 
Microphone Sensor  and Motion sensor  which gives inputs for theft detection
Robotic arm for caring the objects
And gear for parallel adjustment
And the body is made with MFD [ Medium Density Fiberboard ]

A prototype was built using Arduino and Node MCU with Serial communication and channeled processing on a laptop through IoT through the webserver. This prototype can be easily converted to Raspberry Pi.

I just want to showcase an efficient way to deploy an AI in a Microcontroller 
so that anyone affordably deploys Machine learning and deep learning model in a Microcontroller.
I know there are many different processors where AI can be deployed, but they are not budget-friendly
For beginner 



## Features

#### Demo of this project watch this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/Z5rdSA0lvNo)
##OpenCV Features
- Self-driving/Learning.
- Object Detection.
- Body tracking.
- Face detection.
 ##Open cv with Robotic Arm
[face detection Mode and Object detection ]

By the combination of face detection Mode and Object detection,
If a user needs something you just need to call AMIGO BOT and say what u need!
And Amigo search it for you and start object detection mode after locating an object, it picks up and gets switched with face detection then it locates and gives it to the user
AMIGO takes Commands with speech recognition and is further operated autonomously.
It does this with the help of open cv and custom object detection. 
##Self-driving and Learning Explained
Behavior Cloning
I used Behavior Cloning the human will drive the robot around & Ai will not only learn how to drive the robot but also abstractify features, and try to understand why the human is driving the robot the way they were. This ability to abstractify is actually what makes this Ai so Powerful.
And will allow The Ai to drive the situation it's never seen before.Based on this information I chose the behavior cloning model for this Ai.To train the Ai used Webserver with IoT controlled. Which allowed me remotely steer the robot as it learned
##Theft Detection Mode Explained
[Body tracking and Face detection]

Think about a thief breaking into your house. A thief will make certain sounds and motions which the robot will detect and locate while Triggering Theft Detection mode By the combination of Body tracking and Face detection When The assistant is in the Theft detection mode After An sound is detected with the sensor The Assistant initiate Body Tracking Algorithm: If the Body is detected a primary alert is sent to the user After Monitoring body tracking, it switches with Face detection. If an unknown face registered is found the final Alert is Activated. And send an alert message to the user
So this is how theft detection works. This can be a major solution for household security.
##MAKING OF THE ROBOT

This is the making of the AMIGO BOT, which took more than 4-months For research,
Training and deployment. The AI Data was created by training costume model
Experimenting and perfecting the model required lots of time.

##PROTOTYPE APPROACHES
I made a prototype with Arduino & node MCU with Serial communication and channel, 
processing with a laptop through IoT and webserver. This prototype can easily be shifted to Resbery pi Due
to the High pricing of raspberry pie, I have Implemented this in Arduino and Nodemcu The second version of the bot
will be definitely implemented in Resbery pi.

## API Keys
To run this program you will require a bunch of API keys. Register your API key by clicking the following links

- [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- [Wolframalpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/)
- [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/calendar/auth)


##AMIGO SOFTWARE
Amigo comes with software  with speech recognition and voice command which Helps A User with easy Automation For PC as  it's integrated with Webserver a user can control And customize the Amigo bot With its need this Software comes with many unique features
Which help user to save time and energy. As a Developer, I have created developing tools which are very helpful for the developers for easiness in work
Custom Modules: I have created many new modules for the AMIGO, One of the best is Custom Voice for the Amigo comes with a real and friendly voice that helps for human interaction and shows realism.
###These are the Screen-Shots of the

####There are more than 70 + Features built for development and automation.
Some of these are listed here.
Advanced Editing
System Management
Web Automation
And many More
##MARKET OPPORTUNITIES
- There are a lot of people who work on models that require assessment in the industry like they will need tools and the AMIGO bot can help them or give them the tools that are needed.

- Additionally, it will also help with home automation and it will be responsible for remembering all of your day-to-day activities in the home. moreover, it will make any home most secure!

- We need intelligent automation in huge industries, and 83 percent of manufacturers agree that this kind of automation can reduce a lot of costs.

- It can be treated as a pet and also ensure home security! Help to Memories and locate trained Objects .




##IMPROVEMENT

Improvements needed for the Amigo bot:
To improve, more training data is needed as in the prototype stage, the training data is limited. More data and experimenting results could make the learning process more interactive.
## FUTURE UPGRADES
This was my MARK 2 of the ROBOT , As for the MARK 1 is uploaded on my Youtube channel [Codesempai]
The MARK 3 and 4 will be deployed in Single board processing UNIT like Resbery pi/Jetson Nano And more Advancement in the Process will be Done.
##Achievements
This AMIGO BOT got selected in 2nd RUNNER-UP in National Hackathon,
Also winning cash price and goodies

## Code Structure


    ├── driver
    ├── Jarvis              # Main folder for features 
    │   ├── config          # Contains all secret API Keys
    │   ├── features        # All functionalities of JARVIS 
    │   └── utils           # GUI images
    ├── __init__.py         # Definition of feature's functions
    ├── gui.ui              # GUI file (in .ui format)
    ├── main.py             # main driver program of Jarvis
    ├── requirements.txt    # all dependencies of the program

- The code structure if pretty simple. The code is completely modularized and is highly customizable
- To add a new feature:
  -  Make a new file in features folder, write the feature's function you want to include
  - Add the function's definition to __init__.py
  - Add the voice commands through which you want to invoke the function


## Future Improvements
- Arduino interaction / Serial Comunication
- Node MCU interaction
- Generalized conversations can be made possible by incorporating Natural Language Processing
- GUI can be made more nicer to look at and functional
- More functionalities can be added
